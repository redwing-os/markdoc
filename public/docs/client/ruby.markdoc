## VectorDB gRPC Ruby Service Definition

This document provides an overview of the VectorDB gRPC service and associated message types defined in `vectordb.proto`. The Ruby classes generated by the Protocol Buffer compiler are used to interact with the VectorDB service.

## Overview

The VectorDB service offers a gRPC interface for operations related to vector storage and retrieval, such as writing, reading, updating, deleting, and searching for vectors.

## Generated Ruby Classes

- `Vectordb::VectorWriteRequest`
- `Vectordb::VectorBatchWriteRequest`
- `Vectordb::VectorWriteResponse`
- `Vectordb::VectorReadRequest`
- `Vectordb::VectorReadResponse`
- `Vectordb::VectorUpdateRequest`
- `Vectordb::VectorUpdateResponse`
- `Vectordb::VectorDeleteRequest`
- `Vectordb::VectorDeleteResponse`
- `Vectordb::VectorSearchRequest`
- `Vectordb::VectorSearchResponse`
- `Vectordb::SearchResult`

## Service Methods

The gRPC service includes the following methods:

- `Search`: Searches for vectors similar to the given query vector.
- `BatchWrite`: Writes a batch of vectors to the database.
- `Write`: Writes a single vector to the database.
- `Read`: Reads a vector from the database using a key.
- `Update`: Updates an existing vector in the database.
- `Delete`: Deletes a vector from the database using a key.

## Descriptors and Pool Initialization

The Ruby code initializes a descriptor pool with the serialized descriptor data for the defined messages. This setup is crucial for allowing the Ruby classes to work with the vector data according to the schema defined in the `.proto` file.

## Usage

To use the generated classes, require the generated code file in your Ruby application and interact with the VectorDB service using the classes and methods provided.

## Error Handling

The code includes a rescue block for a `TypeError` that might occur during the initialization of the descriptor pool. It also contains warnings about potential import path issues that might arise due to inconsistencies in the proto files' fully-qualified names.

## Dependencies

The generated classes depend on the `google/protobuf` gem for Protocol Buffers support in Ruby.

## Note

This is an auto-generated file by the protocol buffer compiler and should not be edited manually. Any changes to the service definition should be made in the `vectordb.proto` file and recompiled.
